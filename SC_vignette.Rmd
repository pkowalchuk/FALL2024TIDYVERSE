```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

### Objective:

#### To demonstrate how to use the `rowwise()` function in the `tidyverse` `dplyr` package to apply multiple custom functions requiring contextual row information to a data frame.

### Step 1:

Import the following dataset from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/unisex-names) that represents the male and female shares of popular unisex names in the US.

```{r import, paged.print=TRUE}
names <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/refs/heads/master/unisex-names/unisex_names_table.csv")

print(head(names, 10))
```

### Step 2:

Create a custom function to add a new column indicating if the share gap is male-favored (M) or female-favored (F).

This function `set_MF()` will accept as its parameter a vector containing the `male_share` and the `female_share` of the "current" row. Use bracket notation and the index to access each value.

It will return a relevant string or `NA`.

```{r custom-func-1}
set_MF <- function(vec) {
  male <- vec[1]
  female <- vec[2]

  if (male == female) {
    return(NA)
  } else {
    ifelse(male > female, "M", "F")
  }
}
```


Create a second custom function to convert the values in the `gap` column from a difference in proportion to a raw number of people (rounded).

This function `get_num()` will also accept a vector for its parameter; this time for the `total` number of people for the row and the percentage `gap`. It will return the rounded product of the two values.

```{r custom-func-2}
get_num <- function(vec) {
  total <- vec[1]
  gap <- vec[2]
  
  return(round(total * gap))
}
```

### Step 3:

To apply the above custom functions, the data frame is first piped in to the `rowwise()` function below. Then via `mutate()`, each of the new/changed columns is set as equal to the function with vectors of the column names as the arguments.

```{r mutate}
new_names <- names |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(
    favor = set_MF(c(male_share, female_share)),
    gap = get_num(c(total, gap))
)

print(head(new_names, 10))
```

### Conclusion

Per the `dplyr` documentation, `rowwise()` "allows you to compute on a data frame a row-at-a-time. This is most useful when a vectorised function doesn't exist."

So when a custom function requires multiple values from the same row as input, and not just the current "cell" value, `rowwise()` can be used to apply one (or many) function(s) to a data frame easily.



### Extend- AA

I will would to know the maximum and minimum used name.

```{r}
Min_used_name<-new_names[which.min(new_names$total),]#find the min used name from the dataframe
Max_used_name<-new_names[which.max(new_names$total),]#find the max used name from the dataframe

cat("Least used name:", Min_used_name$name, "with total of", Min_used_name$total, "\n")#used concatenate to print the name and value, and "\n" to move the next argument to the next line.
cat("Most used name:", Max_used_name$name, "with total of", Max_used_name$total)#used concatenate to print the name and value
```

Used arrange function from tidyverse to check my the max an min

```{r}
new_names%>% arrange(desc(total))#descending order Casey should be the first name
```

```{r}
new_names%>% arrange(total)#ascending order Aeon should be the first name
```

I was able find the max and min used name from the data set Stephanie had tidy called "new names". I found that Aeon is the minimum used unisex name and Casey is the max used unisex name, using the "which min" and "which max" function and I checked my work using arrange to sort the names by ascending and descending total usage.
